# How to Generate the Presentation

The presentation file (`create_presentation.js`) is ready, but requires Node.js and pptxgenjs to run.

## To Generate the Presentation:

1. **Install Node.js** (if you don't have it):
   - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
   - Choose LTS version

2. **Install pptxgenjs**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pptxgenjs
   ```

3. **Generate the presentation**:
   ```bash
   cd genai-hackathon-project
   node create_presentation.js
   ```

This will create **MoodBeats-Presentation.pptx** with 10 professional slides.

## Presentation Slides Include:

1. **Title Slide** - MoodBeats branding
2. **The Problem** - Why music generation is needed
3. **Our Solution** - How MoodBeats solves it
4. **Key Features** - 6 main features with icons
5. **How It Works** - 5-step process flow
6. **Technical Architecture** - 4-layer system design
7. **User Interface** - Screenshot placeholders
8. **Market Potential** - 4 target markets
9. **Why We Win** - 6 competitive advantages
10. **Thank You** - Call to action

## Alternative: Use PowerPoint Template

If you can't run Node.js, I've also created a manual template in the README that you can follow to create slides in PowerPoint directly.
